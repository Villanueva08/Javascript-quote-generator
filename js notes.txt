javascript lesson

data types of javascript

1. Undefined - variable that hasn't been set yet
2. Null - nothing
3. Boolean - true or false
4. String
5. Symbol - primitive unique number
6. Number
7. Objects - key value pairs

variable - label of a data

Array

use [] for array
length = index to add an element to the last index
push(value) = adds element on the last index
unshift(value) = adds an element on the first index

To delete an element on the array
length = change length to desired number
pop() = deletes the last element
shift() = deletes the first element
slice(start, end) = gets a part of the array
--------------------------------------------------
advance function

declaration vs definition

what ever is inside () is called a parameter
arguments = when you're calling the variable's parameter

Global function = variable inside function cannot be access outside the scope and function can access all variables inside the global scope

outer function can't access variable inside inner function but inner function can access any variable inside the scope

${variable} = new way to concatinate
-----------------------------------------------------
Looping

FOR LOOP
first is to set the initial value, then create a condition lastly is to increment

--------------------------------------------------------
OOP crash course

Object literals

values = specific info set by you
keys = Title of any info in your variable

Prototype = if you want to store a specific info and do not want it to belong in the object itself

Inheritance = to create new object and inherit the properties of other object

tagalog explanation

Constructor = eto yung mga info na sineset mo yung value para madescribe yung isang function

ex: may function na ang name nya is Employee, si Employee ay may pangalan, edad, at trabaho(eto yung bumubuo sa isang constructor).

Document Object Model

**basically, JS is used when you want to manipulate data in HTML with changing what's inside of it

Stepbystep Guide
First is to create a variable for us to manipulate classes and ID's. 
then create a function that you want js to do in your code
then deploy it using event listener

let btn = document.querySelector('.button') - allows us to manipulate the button by creating a variable

Use of query vs queryAll:

query - ginagamit kapag isang parameter lang sa list ang imamanipulate. it select the first item na magmatch sa given parameter. accept all css selectors 

for example there are a lot of div in an HTML file, then you can only manipulate the first div

* you can't manipulate query with for loop because it can only manipulates the first part of the parameter


queryall - pwedeng manipulate ang buong list sa pamamagitan ng for loop

Event Listener = ginagamit para utusan si js na gawin ang specific function sa object

Event Probagation - refers to how event travels through DOM
3 phases of Event Probagation
1. Event Capturing
2. Target
3. Event Bubbling

Event Delegation - allows users to append a single event listener to a parent element that adds it to all of its present and future descendants that match the selector

****Difference between let and const
We use let when we know that the value of the variable may change over time. For example, when we are working with a variable inside a loop, or when we want to update the value of a variable based on user input. On the other hand, we use const when we want to create a variable that should not be reassigned.
